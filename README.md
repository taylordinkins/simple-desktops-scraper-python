Scraper for accessing Simple Desktops

```
python src/main.py --save_path imgs
```

It gets most of the images saved as PNG files. It's decent, could probably be improved using regex instead of just flagging download links and breaking on the assertion, but serves the purpose alright.

Obviously all rights to the images go to the authors listed on the respective pages on [Simple Desktops](http://simpledesktops.com). I claim no ownership over them, nor any responsibility for image use. Please follow all personal use guidelines on [Simple Desktops About Page](http://simpledesktops.com/about/). This is merely to provide convenient access to browse the images locally.
